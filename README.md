# CreditCardFraudDetection

INTRODUCTION:
In modern banking, the usage of credit cards has increased drastically due to the ease and benefits of using credit cards over other methods of payment along with the cases of fraud associated. The banks, merchants and credit card companies lose billions of dollars every year to credit card frauds. It is important for credit card companies to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The aim for this research is to develop a model that can predict the fraudulent transactions accurately to prevent unintended losses incurred to the customers.

Proposed statistical tests (classification models) to predict fraud using R programming language
	•	Decision Trees
	•	Random forest
	•	Logistic regression
	•	k-nn
	•	Support vector machines
